## Chapter 1 - Birth

Far beyond the edge of the world there lived a peasant in a small village. One night she woke him
an extraordinary idea - I could become Oracle, Reactive Oracle. If there would be only tutor
willing to show me the way.
 
Reactive Oracle needs time (up to 3 seconds) to ponder a question and provide random answer from list: 
* Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
* A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
* Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.
* Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.

Would you like to become the tutor and guide of a simple peasant to his way of enlightenment?

in an empty forest. Reactive Oracle lived a simple live enjoying his existence. 
He was almost happy... Almost.

One day the village visited by a young pilgrim. He saw Reactive Oracle meditating and his curiosity 
lead him closer. 

Reactive Oracle said:

The pilgrim thought: I'll ask question and the next question after I've heard the answer to

The pilgrim was surprised by wisdom and knowledge radiating from Reactive Oracle answers and 
only if Reactive Oracle could think quickly through asked questions the pilgrim could become
a king. The pilgrim started to think through the issue. The challenge looked impossible to overcome.
His thoughts become more and more grim. Suddenly two joyful children come closer and began to ask
questions Reactive Oracle one by the other.

Reactive Oracle still pondered their questions but responded both of them at same time. The pilgrim
realized: - I can ask all my question at the same time and listen to Reactive Oracle answers when
he'll speak them.
